# Codewars Python Challenges

This repository contains my solutions to Python coding challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), a platform where I practice and improve my problem-solving skills.

## Purpose

I'm using Codewars to:

- Strengthen my Python skills
- Learn different ways to solve problems
- Rank up by completing katas from various difficulty levels

## Topics & Techniques

The exercises cover a wide range of Python topics, such as:

- Strings and lists
- Loops and conditionals
- Dictionaries and sets
- Functional programming
- Algorithms and logic

## Progress

I regularly update this repo as I complete new challenges and level up my rank.
